# Controller

An 8 voice MIDI to CV and 16-step sequencer module controlled by a Raspberry Pi (see code [here](https://github.com/MatthewATaylor/Modular-Synth-Software)).

### Note: Schematic Errors

* All buttons should be connected to 3V3 rather than 5V
* ADC input must go through a voltage divider to better fit within its input range
