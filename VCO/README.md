# VCO

A simple voltage controlled oscillator based on the [VCO-1 design by Thomas Henry](https://www.birthofasynth.com/Thomas_Henry/Pages/VCO-1.html), including:

* Triangle, sine, PWM, and sawtooth outputs
* Linear and exponential FM
* A switch for choosing between slow (LFO) and fast (1V/oct, audio rate) frequency ranges
